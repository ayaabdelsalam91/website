I am Co-Founder and CSO of [Guide Labs](https://www.guidelabs.ai/), previously a Senior ML Scientist at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) in Genentech. What interests me most about machine learning is not just the strong predictive power these models have, but rather the why. I like to ask questions like: why did the model make this prediction? What is the model learning? This drives my interpretability research, where I work to make neural networks more interpretable. I believe understanding machine learning models better will lead us to build stronger, more powerful models.
I have published over a dozen papers in top ML conferences including NeurIPS and ICLR. I received my PhD at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by [Hector Corrada Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/) and [Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).
