I am an ML scientist at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design) in Genentech. What interests me most about machine learning is not the strong predictive power they have but rather the *why*. I like to ask questions like *why did the model make this prediction?* or *what is the model learning?* so I do interpretability research, I try to make neural networks more interpretable. I think understanding machine learning models better will lead us to build stronger, more powerful models. I have published over a dozen papers in top ML conferences including NeurIPs and ICLR. I received my PhD at the University of Maryland, where I was advised by [Hector Corrada Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/) and [Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).
